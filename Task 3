Task 3: MySQL Database Operations with Python 
Problem Statement:
Your task is to write a Python program that accomplishes the following:
First create a database , table and add these column ‘student_id’, ‘first_name’, ‘last_name’,
‘age’, ‘grade’.
Connects to your MySQL database with python.
Inserts a new student record into the "students" table with the following details:
First Name: "Alice"
Last Name: "Smith"
Age: 18
Grade: 95.5
Updates the grade of the student with the first name "Alice" to 97.0.
Deletes the student with the last name "Smith."
Fetches and displays all student records from the "students" table.
Code
First we have to use mysql-connector library in python for connecting to the MYSQL Database. 
So Install the library 
pip install mysql-connector-python
Python Code:
import mysql.connector
# Connect to MySQL database
db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
 host="your_host",
 user="your_username",
 password="your_password",
 database="your_database"
)
# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
cursor = db_connection.cursor()
# Create "students" table
create_table_query = """
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
 student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
 first_name VARCHAR(255),
 last_name VARCHAR(255),
 age INT,
 grade FLOAT
)
"""
cursor.execute(create_table_query)
# Insert a new student record
insert_query = """
INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, age, grade)
VALUES ('Alice', 'Smith', 18, 95.5)
"""
cursor.execute(insert_query)
# Commit changes to the database
db_connection.commit()
# Update the grade of the student with the first name "Alice"
update_query = """
UPDATE students
SET grade = 97.0
WHERE first_name = 'Alice'
"""
cursor.execute(update_query)
# Commit changes to the database
db_connection.commit()
# Delete the student with the last name "Smith"
delete_query = """
DELETE FROM students
WHERE last_name = 'Smith'
"""
cursor.execute(delete_query)
# Commit changes to the database
db_connection.commit()
# Fetch and display all student records
select_query = "SELECT * FROM students"
cursor.execute(select_query)
students = cursor.fetchall()
print("\nAll Student Records:")
for student in students:
 print(student)
# Close the cursor and database connection
cursor.close()
db_connection.close()
